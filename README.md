Description	:	This project focuses on building an Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system using historical air quality data collected from public APIs. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed in Python to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare time-series inputs using a sliding window approach.An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to learn temporal patterns in the data and predict next-day AQI values. The model was trained and evaluated using standard regression metrics to assess prediction accuracy. The project was executed on a local system and provided hands-on experience in time-series analysis, deep learning model development, model evaluation, and basic result visualization using Python and a lightweight Flask interface.
